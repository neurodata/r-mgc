# Overview

In modern scientific discovery, it is becoming increasingly critical to uncover whether one property of a dataset is related to another. The `MGC` (pronounced *magic*), or Multiscale Graph Correlation, provides a framework for investigation into the relationships between properties of a dataset and the underlying geometries of the relationships, all while requiring sample sizes feasible in real data scenarios.

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The `MGC` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For minimal performance, this will be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 16+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the recommended specs (16 GB RAM, 4 cores@3.3 GHz) and internet of speed 25 Mbps.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

This package is supported for *Linux* operating systems. The package has been tested on the following systems:

Linux: Ubuntu 16.04  
Mac OSX:  
Windows:  

Before setting up the `MGC` package, users should have `R` version 3.4.0 or higher, and several packages set up from CRAN.

#### Installing R version 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 16.04

the latest version of R can be installed by adding the latest repository to `apt`:

```
sudo echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

which should install in about 20 seconds.

#### Package dependencies

Users should install the following packages prior to installing `mgc`, from an `R` terminal:

```
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'reshape2', 'Rmisc', 'devtools', 'testthat', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'latex2exp', 'MASS', 'HHG', 'energy', 'Matrix', 'DTMCPack'))
devtools::install_github("neurodata/meda")
```

which will install in about 80 seconds on a recommended machine.

#### Package Versions

The `mgc` package functions with all packages in their latest versions as they appear on `CRAN` on October 15, 2017. Users can check [CRAN snapshot](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine/) for details. The versions of software are, specifically:
```
ggplot2: 2.2.1
reshape2: 1.4.2
Rmisc: 1.5
devtools: 1.13.3
testthat: 0.2.0
knitr: 1.17
rmarkdown: 1.6
latex2exp: 0.4.0
MASS: 7.3
```

If you are having an issue that you believe to be tied to software versioning issues, please drop us an [Issue](https://github.com/neurodata/mgc/issues). 

# Installation Guide

From an `R` session, type:

```
require(devtools)
install_github('neurodata/mgc', build_vignettes=TRUE)  # install mgc with the vignettes
require(mgc)  # source the package now that it is set up
vignette("MGC", package="mgc")  # view one of the basic vignettes
```

The package should take approximately 20 seconds to install with vignettes on a recommended computer. 

# Demo

## MGC Demo

The `mgc` demo can be run as follows:

```
require(mgc)
set.seed(12345)
mgc.sample(mgc::test_xunif, mgc::test_ylin)$statMGC  # test with a linear relationship between x and y
```

the x data provided is by sampling 100 times from a uniform distribution on the interval [-1, 1], and the y data is formed by adding normally distributed error with variance 0.2 (indicating a linear relationship).

and is expected  to produce the following result exactly approximately *instantaneously*:

```
0.891153
```

a more interactive demo is provided in the package vignette:

```
library(mgc)
vignette("MGC", package="mgc")
```


## Discriminability Demo

### Simulated Dataset

Here, we assume that we have 5 independent sources of a measurement, and take 10 measurements from each source. Each measurement source *i = 1:n* is a random variable where measurements taken at the source for the *j*'th dimension is normally distributed with mean *i*.

```
library(mgc)

nsrc <- 5
nobs <- 10
d <- 20
src_id <- array(1:nsrc)
set.seed(12345)
labs <- sample(rep(src_id, nobs))
dat <- t(sapply(labs, function(lab) rnorm(d, mean=lab, sd=0.5)))
discr.stat(dat, labs)  # expect high discriminability since measurements taken at a source have the same mean and sd of only 0.5
```

which should show approximately *instantaneously*:

```
0.9983889
```

A more interactive demo can be found in the discriminability vignette:

```
library(mgc)
vignette("Discriminability", package="mgc")
```

## Network Test Demo

In testing network dependence on nodal attributes, we first derive multiscale diffusion map embeddings and calculate the statistics at each diffusion time. 

As an input we need 'igraph' object `G` and nodal attributes `X`. Here we generate a random graph from Stochastic Block Model of two blocks with size 100, and block sizes are 30 and 70 respectively. Distribution of the first nodal attributes `X1` is totally dependent on block membership while that of the second nodal attributes `X2` is partially dependent on block membership.

```
library(mgc)
library(igraph)

pm <- cbind( c(.3, .2), c(.2, .3) )
set.seed(1234)
g <- sample_sbm(100, pref.matrix=pm, block.sizes=c(30,70))
x <- c(rbinom(70, 1, 0.3), rbinom(30, 1, 0.1))
sim.result = NetworkTest(g, x, option = 'mgc', t.max = 10, n.perm = 500, default.q = 10, default.t = 3)
print(sim.result$pval)
print(sim.result$optimal.t)
```
then you have:

```
0.112
2
```
as p-value and optimal diffusion time respectively.

A more interactive demo can be found in the network test vignette:
```
library(mgc)
vignette("NetworkTest", package="mgc")
```

# Instructions for Use

## MGC Use

In the below tutorial, we show the result of `MGC` to determine the relationship between the first (sepal length) and third (petal length) dimensions of the `iris` dataset, which should run in about 2 seconds:

```
library(mgc)
set.seed(12345)
res <- mgc.sample(iris[,1], iris[,3])
mgc.plot.plot_matrix(res$localCorr, title="MGC Corr Map, Sepal Length and Petal Length",
    xlab="Sepal Length Neighbors", ylab="Petal Length Neighbors", legend.name = "statMGC")
print(res$statMGC)
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8883547/32355967-7de64590-c008-11e7-9c3b-e24470fdbdaa.png)

with the following statistic:

```
0.7337225
```

viewing the corr map above we see that the relationship betweel Sepal and Petal Length is somewhat linear.


### Help

Instructions for help using the `MGC` statistic can be invoked from the `R` terminal window:

```
help("mgc.sample")
```

which produces the `man` page:

```

## Discriminability Use

Below, we show how discriminability might be used on real data, by demonstrating its usage on the first $4$ dimensions of the `iris` dataset, to determine the relationship between the flower species and the distances between the different dimensions of the iris dataset (sepal width/length and petal width/length):

```
library(mgc)
Dx <- as.matrix(dist(iris[sort(as.vector(iris$Species), index=TRUE)$ix,c(1,2,3,4)]))

mgc.plot.plot_matrix(Dx, xlab="Sorted by Species", ylab="Sorted by Species", title="Distance Matrix for Iris Dataset", legend.name="dist(x, y)")
```

which produces the following distance matrix. The block structure indicates that the flowers from a particular species have more similar properties (as defined by the euclidian distance) to the flowers in the same species than to flowers of different species:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8883547/32355935-466bf308-c008-11e7-980a-64ac3a1b22da.png)

this is confirmed by the high discriminability statistic which should occur approximately *instantaneously*:

```
discr.stat(iris[,c(1,2,3,4)], as.vector(iris$Species))
```

which should show:

```
0.9320476
```

### Help

The help page for the discriminability statistic can be invoked as follows:

```
help("discr.stat")
```

and shows:

```
Discriminability Statistic

Description

    + a [n x d] data matrix, Otherwise
+ ids	[n] is a vector containing the labels for our n observations.
+ remove_outliers=TRUE	boolean indicating whether to ignore observations with rdf below a certain cutoff.
+ thresh=0	the threshold below which to ignore observations. If thresh > 0, ignores observations where the rdf is < thresh in the discriminability computation.

    + TRUE print output to console
    + FALSE Do not print output to console

Returns
+ discr the discriminability statistic.

### Network Test Use

We demonstrate how to apply multiscale network testing using diffusion map and `MGC` in testing independence between social network between members of a university karate club and their faction membership. 

```
data(karate)
G = karate
X = V(karate)$Faction
result = NetworkTest(G, X, option = 'mgc', t.max = 10, n.perm = 100, 
                     default.q = 10, default.t = 3)
names(result)                     
```

Then you have the following results:

```
"pval"  "optimal.t"  "dimension"  "localmap"  "localscale"
```

### Help

Detailed instructions for using the `MGC` statistic in testing network dependence can be invoked from the `R` terminal window:
